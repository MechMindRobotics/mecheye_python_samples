# Python Samples

This documentation provides descriptions of Mech-Eye API Python samples for Mech-Eye Industrial 3D Camera and instructions for running the samples on Windows and Ubuntu.

If you have any questions or have anything to share, feel free to post on the [Mech-Mind Online Community](https://community.mech-mind.com/). The community also contains a [specific category for development with Mech-Eye SDK](https://community.mech-mind.com/c/mech-eye-sdk-development/19).

## Sample List

Samples are divided into the following categories: **basic**, **advanced**, and **util**.

* **basic** samples: Connect to the camera and acquire data.
* **advanced** samples: Acquire data in more complicated manners and set model-specific parameters.
* **util** samples: Obtain camera information and set common parameters.

The samples marked with `(OpenCV)` require OpenCV to be installed.

  >Note: If you have installed Mech-Eye SDK before, please   uninstall it firstwith the following command:
  >
  >```bash
  >sudo dpkg -P MechEyeApi
  >```

  * If the system architecture is AMD64, execute the following command:

     sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-13 20
     ```

  d. Select the g++ version. Enter the number corresponding to the later version ++ to select this version.

     ```bash
     sudo update-alternatives --config g++
     ```

  e. Check if the later version g++ is successfully selected:

     ```bash
     g++ --version
     ```

* Install Python Mech-Eye API:

  ```bash
  sudo pip3 install MechEyeApi
  ```

* (Optional) Install OpenCV if you need to build the samples dependent on OpenCV (refer to the Sample List above):

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
  sudo apt-get install python3-opencv
  ```

#### Instructions

1. Navigate to the folder where a sample is located.

   ```bash
   cd xxx/area_scan_3d_camera
   ```

2. Run the sample: replace ``sample_name`` with the name of the sample.

   ```python
   sudo python3 sample_name.py
   ```

3. Enter the index of the camera to which you want to connect, and press the Enter key. The obtained files are saved to the folder where the sample is located.
