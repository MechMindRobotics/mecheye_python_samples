## Sample list

There are four categories of samples: **Basic**, **Advanced**, **Util**, **Laser** and **UHP**.  

- The category **Basic** contains samples that are related to basic connecting and capturing.  
- The category **Advanced** contains samples that use advanced capturing tricks.  
- The category **Util** contains samples that get and print information and set parameters.  
- The category **Laser** contains samples that can only be used on Mech-Eye Laser cameras.  
- The category **UHP** contains samples that can only be used on Mech-Eye UHP cameras.  

The samples marked with `(Open3D)` require [open3d](https://pypi.org/project/open3d/) to be installed via pip.
The samples marked with `(OpenCV)` require [opencv-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) and [opencv-contrib-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python/) to be installed via pip.
